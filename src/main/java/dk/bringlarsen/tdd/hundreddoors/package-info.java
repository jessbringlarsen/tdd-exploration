/**
 * <h1>Test Scenario: 100 Doors Problem.</h1>
 *
 * There are 100 doors in a row, all initially closed.
 * You make 100 passes by the doors.
 * The first time through, you visit every door and toggle the door
 * (if the door is closed, you open it; if it is open, you close it).
 *
 * <p>
 * The second time you only visit every 2nd door (door #2, #4, #6, ...).
 * The third time, every 3rd door (door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc,
 * until you only visit the 100th door.
 * </p>
 *
 * <b>Question:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>What state are the doors in after the last pass?</li>
 *   <li>Which are open, and which are closed?</li>
 * </ul>
